5.	List the location number and name of locations that are part of the “Basketball arena”.  Your WHERE clause should not have a condition involving the facility number compared to a constant (“F101”). Instead, you should use a condition on the FacName column for the value of “Basketball arena”.

6.	For each event plan, list the plan number, count of the event plan lines, and sum of the number of resources assigned.  For example, plan number “P100” has 4 lines and 7 resources assigned.  You only need to consider event plans that have at least one line.
